A prototype for **Trove**, a website where people can discover and personalize home goods. Built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). Uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/), and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

To build,

- install npm packages with `npm install`,
- bower packages with `bower install`,
- run tasks (such as compilation and minification of source files) with `gulp`,
- and finally start a server with `npm start`.
