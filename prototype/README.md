# Elsa prototype

## About

This prototype provides the grid framework, front-end components, and a test area to aid in developing the Elsa source.

## Setup

- Run `npm install` in the `prototype/` directory.
- Navigate to `index.html` in your browser, or run a local server.
- `index.html` references CSS, JavaScript, and icons that are compiled and minified by Grunt into the `dist/` directory.
- Run `grunt` to run tests locally and compile the CSS and JavaScript into `/dist`. More info on the [Bootstrap repository](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap#compiling-css-and-javascript).
